#Hacker News

This app uses the API from the Hacker News website (https://news.ycombinator.com) to provide a feed of the top, best, and new stories from yCombinator.

This was just an experiment in using Internet APIs, and being able to provide real-time update to an app. Also included some functionality that responded to user interaction (e.g. loading 50 more article when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list view).
